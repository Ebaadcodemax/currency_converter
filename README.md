üí∏ Currency Converter
This is a simple web-based currency converter that allows you to convert an amount from one currency to many others in real-time. It's a clean and straightforward tool for getting current exchange rates powered by a third-party API.

Features
Real-Time Conversion: Fetches the most up-to-date exchange rates.

Simple Interface: A clean and user-friendly design to easily input values and see results.

Dynamic Table: Displays a table of converted amounts for a wide range of currencies.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
This application is built with a simple stack of core web technologies.

HTML: Structures the web page, including the form and the output table.

CSS: Styles the application, providing a modern and responsive design.

JavaScript: The main logic of the application. It handles user input and makes an API call to fetch currency data.

The application uses the CurrencyAPI to get the live exchange rates. When you click the "Submit" button, the JavaScript code sends a request to the API with your selected currency and amount. The API returns the data, which is then used to dynamically populate the table on the page.
